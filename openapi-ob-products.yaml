                have common needs and respond similarly to a marketing action.
                Market segmentation enables companies to target different
                categories of consumers who perceive the full value of certain
                products and services differently from one another.

                            The annual equivalent rate (AER) is interest that is
                            calculated under the assumption that any interest
                            paid is combined with the original balance and the
                            next interest payment will be based on the slightly
                            higher account balance. Overall, this means that
                            interest can be compounded several times in a year
                            depending on the number of times that interest
                            payments are made.

                      1. Banded
                      Interest rates are banded. i.e. Increasing rate on whole
                      balance as balance increases.
                      2. Tiered
                      Interest rates are tiered. i.e. increasing rate for each
                      tier as balance increases, but interest paid on tier fixed
                      for that tier and not on whole balance.
                      3. Whole
                      The same interest rate is applied irrespective of the PCA
                      balance

                            The annual equivalent rate (AER) is interest that is
                            calculated under the assumption that any interest
                            paid is combined with the original balance and the
                            next interest payment will be based on the slightly
                            higher account balance. Overall, this means that
                            interest can be compounded several times in a year
                            depending on the number of times that interest
                            payments are made.

                                Market segmentation is a marketing term
                                referring to the aggregating of prospective
                                buyers into groups, or segments, that have
                                common needs and respond similarly to a
                                marketing action. Market segmentation enables
                                companies to target different categories of
                                consumers who perceive the full value of certain
                                products and services differently from one
                                another.

                                    paid/applied. It can be:-
                                    1. Banded
                                    Interest rates are banded. i.e. Increasing
                                    rate on whole balance as balance increases.
                                    2. Tiered
                                    Interest rates are tiered. i.e. increasing
                                    rate for each tier as balance increases, but
                                    interest paid on tier fixed for that tier
                                    and not on whole balance.
                                    3. Whole
                                    The same interest rate is applied
                                    irrespective of the product holder's account

                                          The annual equivalent rate (AER) is
                                          interest that is calculated under the
                                          assumption that any interest paid is
                                          combined with the original balance and
                                          the next interest payment will be based
                                          on the slightly higher account balance.
                                          Overall, this means that interest can be
                                          compounded several times in a year
                                          depending on the number of times that
                                          interest payments are made.

                                          The annual equivalent rate (AER) is

                                          assumption that any interest paid is
                                          combined with the original balance and
                                          the next interest payment will be based
                                          on the slightly higher account balance.
                                          Overall, this means that interest can be
