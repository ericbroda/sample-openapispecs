        the creditor upon receipt of the amount of money.
        If the business context requires the use of a creditor reference or a
        payment remit identification, and only one identifier can be passed
        through the end-to-end chain, the creditor's reference or payment
        remittance identification should be quoted in the end-to-end transaction
        identification.
